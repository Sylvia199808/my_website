# GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "GDP.xlsx"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

## Tidy the Data
```{r reshape_GDP_data}
tidy_GDP_data  <-  UN_GDP_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 4:51, 
              names_to = "Year", 
              values_to = "GDP") %>% 
  transform(GDP = GDP/1e9)

tidy_GDP_data_frame <- data.frame(tidy_GDP_data)

#names
tidy_GDP_data_frame[tidy_GDP_data_frame == "Imports of goods and services"] <- "Imports"
tidy_GDP_data_frame[tidy_GDP_data_frame == "Exports of goods and services"] <- "Exports"
tidy_GDP_data_frame[tidy_GDP_data_frame == "General government final consumption expenditure"] <- "Government expenditure"
tidy_GDP_data_frame[tidy_GDP_data_frame == "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)"] <- "Household expenditure"


glimpse(tidy_GDP_data_frame)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("France","China", "United States")
```

## Visualization

```{r fig.width = 9.5}
tidy_GDP_data_frame_Order <- tidy_GDP_data_frame %>%
  filter(Country %in% country_list, IndicatorName %in% c("Gross capital formation", "Exports", "Imports", "Household expenditure", "Government expenditure"))

tidy_GDP_data_frame_Order[,3]<-factor(tidy_GDP_data_frame_Order[,3], levels = c("Gross capital formation", "Exports","Government expenditure","Household expenditure","Imports")) #to order IndicatorName

tidy_GDP_data_frame_Order %>%
  group_by(Country)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = GDP, color = IndicatorName, group = IndicatorName))+
  geom_line(size = 1)+
  facet_wrap(~Country)+
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(1970,2017, by = 10))+
  labs(title = "GDP components over time", 
       subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD",
       y = "Bilion US$",
       x = "")+
  theme_bw()+
    NULL
```

## Difference Between what we calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe

```{r}
tidy_GDP_data_wide <- tidy_GDP_data_frame %>%
  pivot_wider (names_from="IndicatorName",values_from="GDP")

tidy_GDP_data_frame_wide <- data.frame(tidy_GDP_data_wide)

GDP_data_frame <- data.frame(tidy_GDP_data_frame_wide %>% 
  mutate(GDP_calculated = 
           Household.expenditure + 
           Gross.capital.formation + 
           Government.expenditure + 
           Exports - Imports
         ) %>% 
  mutate(GDP_percentage_diff = 
           percent((GDP_calculated - Gross.Domestic.Product..GDP.)/Gross.Domestic.Product..GDP.)
         )
)

GDP_data_frame
  

```

## GDP proportion

```{r fig.width = 11}
GDP_proportion <- GDP_data_frame %>%
  mutate(C = Household.expenditure/GDP_calculated, 
         G = Government.expenditure/GDP_calculated, 
         I = Gross.capital.formation/GDP_calculated, 
         Net_Exports = (Exports - Imports)/GDP_calculated) %>%
  select(Country, Year, C, G, I, Net_Exports) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 3:6, 
              names_to = "Indicator Name", 
              values_to = "Proportion")

GDP_proportion_frame <- data.frame(GDP_proportion)

#names
GDP_proportion_frame[GDP_proportion_frame == "C"] <- "Household Expenditure"

GDP_proportion_frame[GDP_proportion_frame == "Net_Exports"] <- "Net Exports"

GDP_proportion_frame[,3]<-factor(GDP_proportion_frame[,3], levels = c("Government Expenditure","Gross capital formation","Household Expenditure","Net Exports")) #to order Indicator.Name

GDP_proportion_frame %>%
  filter(Country %in% country_list) %>%

  ggplot(aes(x = Year, 
             y = Proportion, 
             color = Indicator.Name, 
             group = Indicator.Name))+

## Analysis of the last chart

The last chart gives us more insight into the components of GDP for China, France and the United States. We see the proportion of total GDP that each indicator represents, in other words it enables us to understand which indicator is the most important and which is the least for the economy of each country. Last, we can analyse the changes in GDP compostitution over time from 1970 to 2017.

We can see some similarities as well as some differences between the 3 countries. 
First, Net Exports is the lowest indicator, it was even negative for many years for each country: for China until 1985, for France most of the time apart from 1992 to 2006 approximately and for the United States most of the years. This means that during these periods, these countries import more then they export, resulting in Net Export negatively countributing to GDP (i.e. decreasing GDP). 
Second, Household expenditures make up for most of the GDP of France (~55%) and the US (60% - 70%). It was also the case for China until approximately 2003, after that year Gross capital formation started to be the most important component of China's GDP.
Third for both France and the US, Gross capital formation and government expenditures have been quite close to each other, making up for 20% to 25% of France's GDP and 15% to 20% of the US' GDP. Government expenditures for China have remained quite stable in terms of proportion, representing 20% to 25% of the countries' GDP.

To conclude, this data is very coherent with the economic situation of each country, with France and the US being quite similar and China displaying a different GDP's composition. China exports a lot of products abroad while France and the US mostly present a higher imports compared to exports. Additionally, China is a country that has been devleoping itself and growing at a fast pace the last decades, while France and the US remained more stable and this explains why business investments are so important for China and compose most of its GDP.
